# Project Overview 

### To design a CRUD web-app…

*  **Working app name:** UTime (Utility Time)


*  **Target user:**  Share-house members, people who live in a house with multiple people and are forced to share various utilities


*  **Aim:**  Many people around the world are forced to share a home with people who have different schedules and expectations on when to use certain utilities around the house. The purpose of our web app is to make life easier for these people. We aim to create a way in which house members can better organise their utility/amenity schedule, allowing users to book time-slots for different rooms or appliances around the house so that members can plan ahead and avoid unnecessary conflicts.



To be more specific, in this project we will be designing and deploying a CRUD web application using React, Next.js, and Firebase. This project spans semester 2 (July - November). It is to be done in Agile fashion using the Scrum framework, divided into multiple sprints. You can see the policies that we will follow at ([Rules, Standards and Conventions](https://moistblast.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOCS/pages/5111811/Rules+Standards+and+Conventions)). We will be working closely with our client Shizhan as to meet his expectations and requirements for the project. As of now our priorities lie with the essential features, in order to have a working prototype. See below for further details on our team, roles and road-map.
